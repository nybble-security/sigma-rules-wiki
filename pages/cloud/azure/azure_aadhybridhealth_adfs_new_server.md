# How to process *Azure Active Directory Hybrid Health AD FS New Server* rule
This rule This detection uses azureactivity logs (Administrative category) to identify the creation or update of a server instance in an Azure AD Hybrid health AD FS service.
A threat actor can create a new AD Health ADFS service and create a fake server instance to spoof AD FS signing logs. There is no need to compromise an on-prem AD FS server.
This can be done programmatically via HTTP requests to Azure.
